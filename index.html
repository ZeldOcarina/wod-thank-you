      <p>Help save water, starting with the businesses that use it up!</p>
      <p>
        We created Water On Demand to help businesses pay for their water
        treatments as a service, with no money up front. And businesses love it.
        Why? Because your local water utility is overloaded, and water and
        sewage rates are skyrocketing much faster than inflation! Businesses do
        better with their own setup - and so does the planet and the investors
        behind this initiaive set to disrupt an entire industry.
